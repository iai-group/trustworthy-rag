## Data

The dataset includes:
* Automatically generated responses and explanations produced with the GINGER response generation pipeline
* Data from the qualification task used to recruit and screen crowd workers
* Data collected in the main user study, where participants compared reliable and unreliable system-generated responses, with and without explanations

All collected user data, generated responses, and annotations are publicly available for research and reproducibility purposes.
