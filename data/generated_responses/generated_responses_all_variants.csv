1472-1,What is Marvel Studios' approach to diversity for people of color?,"[1, 2, 3]","[""Phase Three was especially crucial for the lead representation of minorities in large Hollywood productions. In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'  So, which heroes with Latino heritage could make the leap from comics to the cinema?"", ""Could Marvel bring Blade into the MCU and the vampires that come with him? Could the magical and mystical elements of Doctor Strange be used as the groundwork for introducing Moon Knight?  Or will Marvel opt for someone else entirely ?  Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.

1431-1,"I hear a lot about banking innovation, but what is Open Banking regulation?","[1, 2, 3]","['Open banking  Open banking is a financial services term as part of financial technology that refers to:  BULLET::::1.  The use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.   BULLET::::2.  Greater financial transparency options for account holders ranging from open data to private data.   BULLET::::3.  The use of open-source technology to achieve the above.   Open banking, as a concept could be considered as a subspecies to the open innovation concept, a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough.  It is linked to shifts in attitudes towards the issue of data ownership illustrated by regulations such as GDPR and concepts such as the Open Data movement.   Section::::History.   In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2.  The new rules included aims to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments through open banking.   In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide - to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.', ""As users consent to share their personal financial data, banking institutions can distribute information via open application programming interfaces, or APIs for short, allowing third parties to leverage this data and create personalized services with a seamless user experience. For instance, users can integrate their existing bank accounts with third-party apps to conveniently track their expenses and follow their individual savings plans.  As we mentioned, the technology behind open banking is using APIs.  An API is a set of functions which allow for sharing data and requests between systems, usually, in a controlled, secure manner.  There are three types of APIs currently applied in finance: Internal APIs used for sharing data across internal systems and users.  Private APIs that let banks exchange data with their partners.  Open APIs (public APIs) that allow for sharing data with a wide group of users while providing limited access to information.  Source: McKinsey The open banking concept gained significant popularity after 2015 when the European Parliament adopted a new payment services directive known as PSD2.  It obligates EU banks and the 9 largest banks in the UK to provide developers with access to customer data via open APIs.  However, the general idea isn't anything new.  Such providers as Mint, Personal Capital, and Numbrs had been leveraging data from customer bank accounts before PSD2."", ""Understanding Open Banking Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app.  Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties).  Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf.  The Promise of Open Banking Open banking is a driving force of innovation in the banking industry.

In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2.

In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide - to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.', ""[2] As users consent to share their personal financial data, banking institutions can distribute information via open application programming interfaces, or APIs for short, allowing third parties to leverage this data and create personalized services with a seamless user experience. For instance, users can integrate their existing bank accounts with third-party apps to conveniently track their expenses and follow their individual savings plans.  As we mentioned, the technology behind open banking is using APIs.  An API is a set of functions which allow for sharing data and requests between systems, usually, in a controlled, secure manner.  There are three types of APIs currently applied in finance: Internal APIs used for sharing data across internal systems and users.  Private APIs that let banks exchange data with their partners.  Open APIs (public APIs) that allow for sharing data with a wide group of users while providing limited access to information.  Source: McKinsey The open banking concept gained significant popularity after 2015 when the European Parliament adopted a new payment services directive known as PSD2.  It obligates EU banks and the 9 largest banks in the UK to provide developers with access to customer data via open APIs.  However, the general idea isn't anything new.  Such providers as Mint, Personal Capital, and Numbrs had been leveraging data from customer bank accounts before PSD2."", ""[3] Understanding Open Banking Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app.  Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties).  Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf.  The Promise of Open Banking Open banking is a driving force of innovation in the banking industry.  By relying on networks instead of centralization, open banking can help financial services customers to securely share their financial data with other financial institutions.  For example, open banking APIs can facilitate the sometimes onerous process of switching from using one bank's checking account service to another bank's.""]","In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2.

1322-13,How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?,"[1, 2, 3]","[""Kyoto Protocol versus the Paris Agreement While the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement both set out to address climate change, there are some key differences between them. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions.  To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.  While the Paris Agreement doesn't have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal.  And the agreement sets forth a requirement for countries to announce their next round of targets every five years—unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed for that objective but didn't include a specific requirement to achieve it."", ""The main aim of the Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels', predominantly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement differs from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last widely adopted amendment to the UNFCCC, in that no annexes are established to lessen responsibility of developing nations.  Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.  President Obama committed the United States to contributing US$3 billion to the Green Climate Fund.  The Fund has set itself a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020.   Article 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country.  Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified."", ""The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries. Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.

Additionally, the Paris Agreement requires countries to update their emission reduction targets every five years, promoting a more dynamic approach to combating climate change, compared to the static targets under the Kyoto Protocol.","The Kyoto Protocol specifically mandated developed countries to meet binding emissions reductions targets, but the Paris Agreement includes all countries and focuses on voluntary targets determined by each nation. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which set distinct categories for developed and developing nations regarding obligations, the Paris Agreement calls for every country to produce plans for emissions reductions, diminishing previous distinctions.

1352-3,How often should I run to lose weight?,"[1, 2, 3]","[""When you start your running program, make a simultaneous effort to eat fewer foods from the right-hand column and more from the left-hand column — especially from the top of the left-hand column. There is proof that it works.  Earlier this year, Danish researchers reported new runners seeking weight loss who ran more than 5km (3.1 miles) per week for one year but did not change their diets lost an average of 8.4 pounds.  Meanwhile, new runners seeking weight loss who ran more than 5km (3.1 miles) per week for one year and did change their diets lost an average of 12.3 pounds.  HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT FASTER Even 12.3 pounds of weight loss in one year might not seem like a lot.  If your goal is bigger than that, there are two things you can do: Run more and eat less.  While it's important to progress slowly, you can continue to progress with your running until you are doing as much as you can with the time, energy and motivation you have.  If you are highly motivated, consider aiming for a long-term goal of building up to 60 minutes of running per day, six days per week."", ""If you cut calories or carbs while running a lot (like during marathon training ), you'll feel sluggish, have poor post-workout recovery, and may not be able to finish your most challenging workouts. Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.

1428-1,What are some popular meat dishes in Chile?,"[1, 2, 3]","[""Chili-laden rustic peasant dishes became less popular and French, German and English influences brought international dishes. Today's Chilean cuisine is a combination of all the above.  It is usually simply cooked without complicated sauces or seasonings.  Meats are usually grilled or boiled for hearty boiled dinners ( cazuelas ), fish are grilled or fried, shellfish are steamed or served in soups or bread thickened pudding-like chupes, and vegetables are served in soups or as salads.  The major seasonings are oregano, cumin, paprika, and a little garlic.  Foreigners often find Chilean cuisine bland (and Chileans find much American and European cooking over seasoned and strong tasting).  The best of Chilean food: Sea food.  Fish and shellfish, simply prepared, are the best Chile has to offer.  Congrio (conger or kingclip) is Chile's favorite and best fish and batter-fried congrio is near the top of everyone's list of Chile's best dishes.  Congrio is also good grilled and in chowders.  The best restaurant dish I ever had in Chile was Caldillo de Congrio, congrio chowder, at the restaurant attached to Pedro Neruda's house-museum in Isla Negra.  Other Chilean fish ( reneta, merluza, corvina, and farm raised salmon) are also good but tend to be overcooked for international taste."", ""These restaurants, specializing in grilled meats, are very popular and if you are a committed meat eater you'll probably want to try one. The parilla mixta (mixed grill--right) serving two or more is popular and hard to pass up.  It will usually include a couple of cuts of beef, pork chops, sausages, chicken and potatoes—a major cholesterolaso .  Individual steaks and chops will also be on the menu.  Most Chilean beef is grass fed and is tasty, but chewy and expensive.  So don't look to Parriladas for that special night-out meal.  Wait until you get to Argentina.  Ethnic cuisines: Although there are some exceptions, Chile's ethnic restaurants tend to be disappointing.  Chinese food is very popular and there are large sit-down restaurants and literally hundreds of take-out places, all serving chicken chop suey and Mongolian beef -- without ginger or garlic.  Since Chinese, Thai, Indian and Mexican cuisines use spices that are not to Chilean tastes, their dishes are often toned down to the point of being almost unrecognizable.  One exception is Korean food which is so un-Chilean that it is often very authentic.  What to drink Wine, of course, but also beer, pisco, mineral water and soft drinks--and tap water."", ""Cover the filling with the corn mixture, then sprinkle on the  confectioners' sugar.

Humitas are a national favorite, and they come from the Amerindians who are  native to Chile.  Humitas are made with grated fresh corn, mixed into a  paste with fried onions, basil, salt, and pepper.  The mixture is then  wrapped in cornhusks and cooked in boiling water.

The major seasonings are oregano, cumin, paprika, and a little garlic.  Foreigners often find Chilean cuisine bland (and Chileans find much American and European cooking over seasoned and strong tasting).  The best of Chilean food: Sea food.

Chinese food is very popular and there are large sit-down restaurants and literally hundreds of take-out places, all serving chicken chop suey and Mongolian beef -- without ginger or garlic.  Since Chinese, Thai, Indian and Mexican cuisines use spices that are not to Chilean tastes, their dishes are often toned down to the point of being almost unrecognizable.

1452-5,How much coral has been bleached?,"[1, 2, 3]","['The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.  The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.  They kept the coral exposed to that heat for more than a week.

For Falcon Heavy, that would mean a price per pound to orbit of less than $500.'"", ""The second launch of the same booster then costs only the mentioned $15 million, which include refurbishment of the booster and payload fairings, production of a new second stage, fuel, the cost of operating a naval recovery fleet, etc. SpaceX charges a little less for launches with a reused booster, so if the second launch carried a payload for a paying customer, SpaceX gets $50 million. That means the total revenue from two launches of that booster is $112 million ($62M + $50M), while the total cost to SpaceX is only $65 million ($50M + $15M).  So SpaceX would have made $47 million in profit after two launches which can potentially cover the costs of at least three Starlink launches, which would then be basically free.  If the given booster launches 10 times in total and we assume that each payload fairing can be used twice on average, the total costs after 10 launches would be around $210 million.

1461-7,"OK, and what can I do to make my bike more comfortable?","[1, 2, 3]","[""However this is completely variable and the reason why you see touring handlebars with multiple positions; so the rider can change hand positions and stretch the back, or sit upright and relieve some pressure. It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.

1392-9,The Taj Mahal sounds beautiful. Tell me more about how the Taj Mahal was built,"[1, 2, 3]","['Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

1482-5,What should I do next after getting an interview with a tech company?,"[1, 2, 3]","[""Practice makes perfect If you've got tech interviews coming up, it's a good idea to get in the habit of working a a couple different coding challenges each day. They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms. It's all on YouTube.  I've made these videos to make it as easy as possible to get to know this topic.  Since there are only 7 videos in this series, you'll need more material to learn more advanced topics.  There are several popular options for this, including: These Stanford courses on Coursera This MIT course on YouTube The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena (a book) Algorithms (another book)  You should try a few of these and continue with the one you like the most.  Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.  After practicing on your own for a few weeks, you should start doing mock interviews.  How to do mock interviews Basically, pair up with your friends, and give each other problems from the resources I mentioned above."", ""Interview tips for success Now that you are comfortable with how to handle the post-interview follow up, here are some interview tips that could help you in your next interview: Research the company first Before your interview, research the company to better understand what they do, what their hiring needs might be and basic information you might be expected to know to get your foot in the door. Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.

In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.

When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.

David McNew/Getty Images Share More"", ""Nixon had won reelection in 1972 by a landslide and began his second term with a lofty 68% Gallup Poll approval rating in January 1973. But the Watergate scandal – which started with an effort to bug the Democratic National Committee office at the Watergate Hotel and subsequent efforts to cover it up – quickly took a heavy toll on those ratings, especially when coupled with a ramp-up in public concerns about inflation.  By April, a resounding 83% of the American public had heard or read about Watergate, as the president accepted the resignations of his top aides John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman.  And in turn, Nixon's approval ratings fell to 48%.  But that was just the beginning of the toll the scandal would take on the president that year.  The televised Watergate hearings that began in May 1973, chaired by Sen. Samuel Ervin, commanded a large national audience – 71% told Gallup they watched the hearings live.  And as many as 21% reported watching 10 hours or more of the Ervin proceedings.  Not too surprisingly, Nixon's popularity took a severe hit.  His ratings fell as low as 31%, in Gallup's early August survey.  The public had changed its view of the scandal."", ""Nixon's onetime opponent George McGovern commented in 1983, 'President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II [ ...]  With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history.'  Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying that Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment by diplomatic, rather than military means.  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation like the War Powers Act and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

But the Watergate scandal – which started with an effort to bug the Democratic National Committee office at the Watergate Hotel and subsequent efforts to cover it up – quickly took a heavy toll on those ratings, especially when coupled with a ramp-up in public concerns about inflation.  By April, a resounding 83% of the American public had heard or read about Watergate, as the president accepted the resignations of his top aides John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman.  And in turn, Nixon's approval ratings fell to 48%.  But that was just the beginning of the toll the scandal would take on the president that year.

Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying that Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment by diplomatic, rather than military means.  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation like the War Powers Act and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

The public resignations of his top aides and the extensive media coverage, including televised hearings watched by a substantial portion of the American populace, underscored the severity of the scandal.

His initially high approval ratings plummeted as the scandal unfolded, evidenced by detailed coverage and the televised Senate Watergate hearings, which were watched by a majority of the American public. Despite some rehabilitation in later years highlighting his diplomatic achievements and civil rights efforts, his presidency is often remembered for the scandal, leading to fundamental mistrust in government and reduced presidential power due to subsequent legislative changes.","The Watergate scandal significantly marred President Nixon's legacy, resulting in heightened public interest and eventually his resignation. It drastically affected his legacy by driving his approval ratings down to a low of 31%.
