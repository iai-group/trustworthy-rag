In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'  So, which heroes with Latino heritage could make the leap from comics to the cinema?"", ""Could Marvel bring Blade into the MCU and the vampires that come with him? Could the magical and mystical elements of Doctor Strange be used as the groundwork for introducing Moon Knight?  Or will Marvel opt for someone else entirely ?  Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit. Coates brought in fresh air to the medium for a few reasons: he has a more political background in writing, and he's a black man writing about a black character.  Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.  The series has been on the New York Times Bestseller list, a true indication that this is high quality material.  In an interview with Makers, Amanat starts off by noting 'authentic storytelling is powerful.'  Ms. Marvel works because she's well rounded.""]"

But most important are the characters.  You could easily make an awesome Okoye, Shuri, Nakia or M'Baku movie.  It's Erik Killmonger, though, and his effect on T'Challa that truly made this movie sit head and shoulders above the rest.  And I love most of the films on this list!  There's so much richness here.  So much to unpack.  This is Marvel Studios at its most mature.  How ironic that it was its youngest director that brought it to fruition.  Amazing.  Best moment: Killmonger's dream.

The Russo Brothers' superhero debut nails the early MCU's all-high-stakes action, while mixing in some of the humor that would come later on.  We salute you, Cap.  Watch Now Batman Returns If we're being honest, any collection of the best supehero movies out there is incomplete without the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton spin on Batman.  Zany, slick, and goth as hell, Batman Returns unexpectedly became a key film in the genre's coming of age.  Watch Now Logan Hugh Jackman played Wolverine for 17 years.  Seventeen years!  That's a lot of push-ups.  That said, it's a wonder that his final turn as the hero, Logan, is by far his best as the character—showing the rare portrait of a superhero left battered from a life lived saving others."", ""Infinity War manages to be emotionally powerful and incredibly funny (often in the same scene), its scale and scope are mind-bogglingly vast, and the crossover character interactions are unexpected and fun. Perhaps, most importantly, Marvel solves its villain problem in spectacular style, with Josh Brolin's Thanos being both the driving force of the movie and a plausible bad guy – his grand plan is clearly deranged, but there's a weird, twisted logic to it.  And without Infinity War there could be no Endgame.  1.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  Here it is.  The best Marvel movie.  The Winter Soldier set a new precedent for the MCU.  The Captain America sequel is a totally different take on the universe – a '70s Cold War thriller that doesn't put a foot wrong.  Hell, The Winter Soldier should be named one of the best Marvel movies of all time for the elevator scene alone; a moment so memorable it was homaged in Avengers: Endgame.  The movie also has far-reaching implications for the rest of the Marvel universe – such as that SHIELD reveal – and establishes the resurrected Bucky Barnes as a major piece in the puzzle for years to come.""]"
2,143,1-1,"I hear a lot about banking innovation, but what is Open Banking regulation?","[3, 3, 3]","['KILT_42423740-1', 'MARCO_32_1186259104-2', 'MARCO_44_737771076-2']","['Open banking  Open banking is a financial services term as part of financial technology that refers to:  BULLET::::1.  The use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.   BULLET::::2.  Greater financial transparency options for account holders ranging from open data to private data.   BULLET::::3.  The use of open-source technology to achieve the above.   Open banking, as a concept could be considered as a subspecies to the open innovation concept, a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough.  It is linked to shifts in attitudes towards the issue of data ownership illustrated by regulations such as GDPR and concepts such as the Open Data movement.   Section::::History.   In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2.  The new rules included aims to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments through open banking.   In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide - to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.', ""As users consent to share their personal financial data, banking institutions can distribute information via open application programming interfaces, or APIs for short, allowing third parties to leverage this data and create personalized services with a seamless user experience. For instance, users can integrate their existing bank accounts with third-party apps to conveniently track their expenses and follow their individual savings plans.  As we mentioned, the technology behind open banking is using APIs.  An API is a set of functions which allow for sharing data and requests between systems, usually, in a controlled, secure manner.  There are three types of APIs currently applied in finance: Internal APIs used for sharing data across internal systems and users.  Private APIs that let banks exchange data with their partners.  Open APIs (public APIs) that allow for sharing data with a wide group of users while providing limited access to information.  Source: McKinsey The open banking concept gained significant popularity after 2015 when the European Parliament adopted a new payment services directive known as PSD2.  It obligates EU banks and the 9 largest banks in the UK to provide developers with access to customer data via open APIs.  However, the general idea isn't anything new.  Such providers as Mint, Personal Capital, and Numbrs had been leveraging data from customer bank accounts before PSD2."", ""Understanding Open Banking Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app.  Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties).  Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf.  The Promise of Open Banking Open banking is a driving force of innovation in the banking industry.  By relying on networks instead of centralization, open banking can help financial services customers to securely share their financial data with other financial institutions.  For example, open banking APIs can facilitate the sometimes onerous process of switching from using one bank's checking account service to another bank's.""]"
3,143,1-5,Does Open Banking exist in the United States?,"[3, 3, 3]","['MARCO_59_690617273-16', 'MARCO_59_690617273-17', 'MARCO_59_690617273-3']","['Banks may want to choose partner institutions that have already engendered a lot of customer trust, including other banks. Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""]"

Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions.  To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.  While the Paris Agreement doesn't have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal.  And the agreement sets forth a requirement for countries to announce their next round of targets every five years—unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed for that objective but didn't include a specific requirement to achieve it."", ""The main aim of the Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels', predominantly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement differs from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last widely adopted amendment to the UNFCCC, in that no annexes are established to lessen responsibility of developing nations.  Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.  This removed the requirement for the United States Congress to ratify the agreement.  In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and accepted it by executive order in September 2016.  President Obama committed the United States to contributing US$3 billion to the Green Climate Fund.  The Fund has set itself a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020.   Article 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country.  Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified."", ""The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries. Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an 'executive agreement rather than a treaty'.  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.  While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this division is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties are required to submit emissions reductions plans.""]"

I have 9 months before my marathon and I'm scared that I won't be able to make it because of my weight.  I don't want to stop running to go on a strict diet but I'm unclear as to how I can lose weight and run at the same time.'  Anne's question echoes many sentiments that I've heard from runners who struggle with weight loss and running.  Have you ever wondered how you can keep losing weight while eating all of the carbs necessary for running?  Or how to control your appetite after a long run?  These are all great questions.  And to answer them, we have to stop thinking about 'diets' and cutting calories because those strategies simply don't work for runners."", ""Repeat for 25 minutes or as your fitness levels allow. Studies have shown that high-intensity intervals will also burn more fat after your workout.  Hit the hills If you're used to running on flat ground, then hit the hills to burn more calories.  For every degree of incline, you get about a 10 percent increase in total calories burnt, so a gentle hill will burn about 50 percent more calories.  Run up the hill at a high intensity for 10 – 30 seconds, jog back down and take a 30 – 60 second rest.  Repeat 4 – 12 times or as your fitness levels alow.  If you're in the gym, set the treadmill to a 5 percent incline for the run, then reset for the jog back.  Not only is this going to burn a lot more fat, but you'll also be hitting your glutes a lot harder, so you'll get a perkier butt too!  Blast off with shuttle runs There's a reason why these guys are so popular in the sporting world – love them or hate them they work!

HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT FASTER Even 12.3 pounds of weight loss in one year might not seem like a lot.  If your goal is bigger than that, there are two things you can do: Run more and eat less.  While it's important to progress slowly, you can continue to progress with your running until you are doing as much as you can with the time, energy and motivation you have.

When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'

But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.

Coastlines would no longer be protected from flooding in extreme storms.  Coral provides a natural breakwater, and a buffer against erosion.  Without it, water would push local residents out of their homes.  As the ocean spread out, the residents of these densely populated islands would have nowhere to go.

Corals even generate the beautiful white sand that is a must-have for many travelers.  Because of their impact on tourism, corals support local populations.  Coral Reefs even save humans lives, as they offer natural coastal protection against storms or hurricanes.  They are also a source for new medicinal remedies to treat cancer, human bacterial infections, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and viruses.  Studies estimate their economic value at US$100 000–600 000 per km² ( UNEP report, 2006 ).  Coral reefs comprise an area of almost 300 000 km² (Italy's total area), thus providing one of the most high-value ecosystems.  Coral reefs are valuable, and that's exactly what we want to illustrate by creating blockchain based assets called CryptoCorals.

An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.

An animation demonstrates the concept.  The three components of SpaceX's planned fully reusable rocket launching system: the first stage (left), second stage (center), and crew capsule (right).  (c) SpaceX Such a rocket, according to Musk, will be capable of being fully ready for launch again 24 hours tops after it last went into orbit, and cost a hundred fold less than it does today to put cargo into space.  Launching the Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9, the rocket SpaceX currently used to launch its Dragon capsule to the International Space Station, costs $10,000 per pound – the reusable rocket would cost only $10 per pound.  ADVERTISEMENT 'That, however, requires a very high flight rate, just like aircraft,' Musk says.  'At a low flight rate, the improvement is still probably around 50 percent.  For Falcon Heavy, that would mean a price per pound to orbit of less than $500.'"", ""The second launch of the same booster then costs only the mentioned $15 million, which include refurbishment of the booster and payload fairings, production of a new second stage, fuel, the cost of operating a naval recovery fleet, etc. SpaceX charges a little less for launches with a reused booster, so if the second launch carried a payload for a paying customer, SpaceX gets $50 million. That means the total revenue from two launches of that booster is $112 million ($62M + $50M), while the total cost to SpaceX is only $65 million ($50M + $15M).  So SpaceX would have made $47 million in profit after two launches which can potentially cover the costs of at least three Starlink launches, which would then be basically free.  If the given booster launches 10 times in total and we assume that each payload fairing can be used twice on average, the total costs after 10 launches would be around $210 million.  As an example from the following table, SpaceX could use each Falcon booster for four commercial launches and then the remaining six could launch Starlink satellites 'for free'.  This is a pretty clear-cut case of booster reusability being worth it."", ""The remaining $5 million include costs of reusing the payload fairings (Musk probably only counts fairing refurbishment costs in this scenario because it costs $5–6 million to manufacture a new set of fairings), helium, fuel and oxygen, and also the cost of recovering the booster and fairings. Most importantly, the cost of refurbishing the recovered booster is only $250,000, according to Musk.  That's a very low amount, which could indicate that the booster refurbishment process does not require much manpower, expensive hardware replacements or complex inspections.  NASA's Space Shuttle was also reusable but the refurbishment process was extremely complex, time-consuming and therefore expensive.  In the end, the mostly reusable Shuttle was actually more expensive than a fully expendable rocket.  Space Shuttle during ground processing which was incredibly complicated and resource-intensive (Credit: NASA) SpaceX offers the launch of a reused Falcon 9 for the price of $50 million, which would mean that, if the $15 million marginal cost is somewhat accurate, the company makes a significant profit on every launch.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.

After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", 'FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']"

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.

Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""]"

Biases can also be a result of social processes, as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non-normative viewpoints in favor of more 'popular' results."", ""Is Google Biased?

The short answer is not likely.  Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google's search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.

Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it's impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.

Can you compare them?,"[4, 4, 4]","['KILT_47185-6', 'MARCO_15_401680439-3', 'MARCO_15_600646838-2']","[""External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]"

David McNew/Getty Images Share More"", ""Nixon had won reelection in 1972 by a landslide and began his second term with a lofty 68% Gallup Poll approval rating in January 1973. But the Watergate scandal – which started with an effort to bug the Democratic National Committee office at the Watergate Hotel and subsequent efforts to cover it up – quickly took a heavy toll on those ratings, especially when coupled with a ramp-up in public concerns about inflation.  By April, a resounding 83% of the American public had heard or read about Watergate, as the president accepted the resignations of his top aides John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman.  And in turn, Nixon's approval ratings fell to 48%.  But that was just the beginning of the toll the scandal would take on the president that year.  The televised Watergate hearings that began in May 1973, chaired by Sen. Samuel Ervin, commanded a large national audience – 71% told Gallup they watched the hearings live.  And as many as 21% reported watching 10 hours or more of the Ervin proceedings.  Not too surprisingly, Nixon's popularity took a severe hit.  His ratings fell as low as 31%, in Gallup's early August survey.  The public had changed its view of the scandal."", ""Nixon's onetime opponent George McGovern commented in 1983, 'President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II [ ...]  With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history.'  Political scientist Jussi Hanhimäki disagrees, saying that Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment by diplomatic, rather than military means.  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation like the War Powers Act and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.
