As tertiary consumers who sit at the apex of the food chain, they affect food webs by preying on both secondary and primary consumers. Moreover, humans are typically not the target of predation by other animals."",""Juvenile predators are vulnerable to threats from their own kind, rival species, and mature prey, and studies indicate that prey that encountered adult predators during their young stages are more inclined to become aggressive toward young predators. This causes adult predators to steer clear of these zones. Additionally, when the typical prey numbers drop drastically, causing a decrease in predator populations, the dynamic between predator and pre can invert, with growing numbers of former prey starting to prey on their previous predators. In cases where predator and prey evolve together, severe impacts by predators on their populations can lead to devastation for both, sometimes resulting in a reversal of roles where prey develop traits typical of predators as both species try to survive."",""Other than enjoying meals, you can stroll along the Sumida River under cherry blossoms, visit Tokyo's ancient temples and experience the stunning Christmas light displays. Additionally, you can explore kabuki theater performances in December and join the New Year's Eve celebrations at local shrines.
