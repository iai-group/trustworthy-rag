In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'  So, which heroes with Latino heritage could make the leap from comics to the cinema?"", ""[2] Could Marvel bring Blade into the MCU and the vampires that come with him? Could the magical and mystical elements of Doctor Strange be used as the groundwork for introducing Moon Knight?  Or will Marvel opt for someone else entirely ?  Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit. Coates brought in fresh air to the medium for a few reasons: he has a more political background in writing, and he's a black man writing about a black character.  Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.  The series has been on the New York Times Bestseller list, a true indication that this is high quality material.  In an interview with Makers, Amanat starts off by noting 'authentic storytelling is powerful.'  Ms. Marvel works because she's well rounded.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], [['[1] Banks may want to choose partner institutions that have already engendered a lot of customer trust, including other banks. Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]"#"[['', ''], ['', ""This response is based only on the model's internal memory and is not grounded in verifiable sources.""], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: Black Panther', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin, so it's not possible to verify each claim against a reliable source.""], ['', ''], [""This response is based only on the model's internal memory and is not grounded in verifiable sources."", ''], ['', ''], [""The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: bistec a lo pobre (poor man's steak)"", 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin, so it's not possible to verify each claim against a reliable source."", '']]"#"[[['Representation of different ethnic groups and genders in superhero roles.', 'Specific challenges faced while implementing these diversity initiatives.', 'Inclusion of diverse writers in the creation of characters and stories.', ""Financial impact of diverse casting on Marvel Studios' earnings.""], ['Introduction of ""Black Panther"" as a major film focusing on an African-American superhero.', ""Plans for introducing a Latino superhero in MCU's Phase Four."", 'Audience reception to the introduction of diverse characters in Marvel films.', ""Marvel Studios' commitment to diversity in casting and character representation.""]], ['', ''], [[""Evaluation of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' on its consistent excellence."", ""Box office performance of 'Black Panther' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'"", 'Recognition of both movies as among the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).', 'Specific plot details or themes of either movie.'], ['Mention of the movie\'s ""twisted logic.""', 'Ranking of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as the top movie in the MCU.', 'Description of the movie as ""unexpected and fun.""', 'Comparison with other MCU movies besides its ranking.']], ['', ''], [['Acceptance among specific demographics (millennials and Gen Z).', 'Industry efforts driving open banking.', 'Regulatory challenges or government policies affecting open banking.', 'Developmental phase of open banking in the U.S.'], ['Early stage of Open Banking development in the U.S. compared to the UK and Europe.', 'Existence of Open Banking in the United States.', 'Technical challenges or security concerns related to Open Banking.', 'Goals of American banks using Open Banking, including digital transformation and recalibrating customer relationships.']], ['', ''], [['Immediate comfort provided by the saddle.', 'Weight of the saddle.', 'Specific material details that make up the saddle.', 'Waterproof characteristics of the saddle.'], ['Cost of the bike seat', 'Anatomical pressure reduction and protection for sensitive areas', 'Customer reviews or satisfaction ratings', 'Installation and compatibility with different bike models']], ['', ''], [['The historical origins of empanadas and bistec a lo pobre.', 'Ingredients of the dishes (beef, olives, onions, steak, fried eggs, French fries).', 'Reference to the cultural significance of these dishes in Chile.', 'Nutritional information about the dishes.'], ['Variations or regional differences in the preparation of these dishes within Chile.', 'Cooking methods for these dishes.', 'Non-meat dish mentioned: humitas, which are primarily corn-based.', 'Nutritional information or dietary considerations related to these dishes.']], ['', ''], [['Historical timeline of interest in rocket engine reusability at NASA.', 'Specific technologies or engineering challenges involved in rocket reusability.', 'Environmental impact or considerations of reusable rockets.', 'Development efforts by the Marshall Space Flight Center.'], ['Economic implications of reusable vs. non-reusable rocket engines.', 'Specifics on the design and execution of reusable ground launch vehicles.', ""Reference to NASA's involvement in reusability projects."", 'Mention of specific dates significant to the topic.']], ['', '']]"

It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.

The success or otherwise of this conference will have stark consequences for the world.  If countries cannot agree on sufficient pledges, in another 5 years, the emissions reduction necessary will leap to a near-impossible 15.5% every year.  The unlikelihood of achieving this far steeper rate of decarbonization means the world faces a global temperature increase that will rise above 1.5°C.  Every fraction of additional warming above 1.5°C will bring worsening impacts, threatening lives, food sources, livelihoods and economies worldwide.  Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made.  Increased commitments can take many forms but overall they must serve to shift countries and economies onto a path of decarbonization, setting targets for net-zero carbon, and timelines of how to reach that target, most typically through a rapid acceleration of energy sourced from renewables and rapid deceleration of fossil fuel dependency.', ""[2] 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference - Wikipedia 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from COP26) Jump to navigation Jump to search 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference  Date 1 – 12 November 2021 Venue SEC Centre Location Glasgow, Scotland, UK Organized by United Kingdom and Italy Participants UNFCCC member countries President Alok Sharma Previous event Madrid 2019 Website www .ukcop26 .org  The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, is the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.

You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People.

Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.

These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes (e.g., companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results), and political processes (e.g., the removal of search results to comply with local laws).  For example, Google will not surface certain neo-Nazi websites in France and Germany, where Holocaust denial is illegal.  Biases can also be a result of social processes, as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non-normative viewpoints in favor of more 'popular' results."", ""[3] Is Google Biased?  New 2021 Case Study Is Google Biased?  We Analyzed 50 Key Politically-Driven Topics to Find Out June 13, 2020 June 12, 2020 by Nathan Gotch Is Google biased against conservatives?  The short answer is not likely.  Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google's search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.  But here's the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google's algorithm is biased.  Let's dive into the case study.  Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it's impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.  Websites that present facts.  Not opinions.  This is super important for politically-driven topics where there tends to be lots of misinformation or ' fake news '.""], '']]"#"[['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: high-intensity_intervals', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], ['', ""This response is based only on the model's internal memory and is not grounded in verifiable sources.""], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin, so it's not possible to verify each claim against a reliable source."", ''], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: mistrust of government, decrease in presidential power', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], [""This response is based only on the model's internal memory and is not grounded in verifiable sources."", ''], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin, so it's not possible to verify each claim against a reliable source.""]]"#"[[['Importance of hydration and nutrition specific to high-intensity running workouts.', 'Use of shuttle runs to incorporate bursts of high intensity into running workouts.', 'Dietary changes to complement a running program for weight loss.', 'High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) as a component of a running regimen for weight loss.'], ['The role of hydration in weight loss and running performance.', 'Integration of fruit and vegetable consumption for weight loss', 'The impact of sleep on weight loss for runners.', 'High-intensity intervals in running']], ['', ''], [['Selecting and positioning a saddle', 'Recommended clothing for comfortable cycling', 'Materials used in bike construction and their effects on comfort', 'Adjusting the reach of the handlebar'], ['Importance of regular breaks and physical conditioning to avoid fatigue while cycling.', 'Professional bike fitting for optimal alignment of bike parts.', 'Adjustment of saddle position (height, tilt, fore/aft).', 'Maintenance and care of the bike to ensure continued comfort.']], ['', ''], [['Mention of the Great Barrier Reef and its extensive bleaching.', 'Ecological and economic impacts of coral reef degradation.', 'Impact on global coral populations by coral bleaching.', 'The role of climate change in coral bleaching.'], ['Economic and ecological importance of coral reefs.', 'Overall percentage of coral that has undergone bleaching.', 'The global percentage of coral reefs that have been lost.', 'Percentage of coral degradation attributed to bleaching.']], ['', ''], [['Specific legal changes or reforms introduced post-Watergate.', ""Nixon's resignation as a result of the scandal."", 'Details about the Watergate break-in and the individuals involved.', 'Impact of the Watergate scandal on public trust in government.'], ['Reduction in the power of the presidency.', 'Mistrust in government caused by the scandal.', 'The impact of the scandal on future U.S. administrations.', 'The specific illegal activities that constituted the Watergate scandal.']], ['', ''], [['The role of the ICO, Action Fraud, and the FCA in preventing scams.', ""Reporting the scam to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)."", 'Importance of informing Action Fraud and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).', 'Possible repercussions for the scammers once caught.'], ['Prevention tips for avoiding investment scams.', 'Advice on how to recover lost funds after falling victim to an investment scam.', 'Reporting the scam to local or national authorities (e.g., police, Action Fraud, the Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam).', 'Long-term impacts of being involved in an investment scam.']], ['', ''], [['User data privacy and storage policies', 'Geographic biases in search engine algorithms', 'Specific examples of content restriction in countries', 'Economic influences on search engines'], ['Technical aspects of how search algorithms are programmed.', 'Social biases that prioritize mainstream views over alternative perspectives.', 'Political bias in search engines.', 'Ethical considerations in the development and implementation of search algorithms.']], ['', '']]"
