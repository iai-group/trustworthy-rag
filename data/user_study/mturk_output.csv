In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'  So, which heroes with Latino heritage could make the leap from comics to the cinema?"", ""[2] Could Marvel bring Blade into the MCU and the vampires that come with him?

Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit. Coates brought in fresh air to the medium for a few reasons: he has a more political background in writing, and he's a black man writing about a black character.  Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.  The series has been on the New York Times Bestseller list, a true indication that this is high quality material.  In an interview with Makers, Amanat starts off by noting 'authentic storytelling is powerful.'

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit. Coates brought in fresh air to the medium for a few reasons: he has a more political background in writing, and he's a black man writing about a black character.  Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.  The series has been on the New York Times Bestseller list, a true indication that this is high quality material.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: Black Panther', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents.""], ['', ''], [""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources."", ''], ['', ''], [""The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: bistec a lo pobre (poor man's steak)"", 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents."", '']]","[[['Representation of different ethnic groups and genders in superhero roles.', 'Specific challenges faced while implementing these diversity initiatives.', 'Inclusion of diverse writers in the creation of characters and stories.', ""Financial impact of diverse casting on Marvel Studios' earnings.""], ['Introduction of ""Black Panther"" as a major film focusing on an African-American superhero.', ""Plans for introducing a Latino superhero in MCU's Phase Four."", 'Audience reception to the introduction of diverse characters in Marvel films.', ""Marvel Studios' commitment to diversity in casting and character representation.""]], ['', ''], [[""Evaluation of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' on its consistent excellence."", ""Box office performance of 'Black Panther' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'"", 'Recognition of both movies as among the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).', 'Specific plot details or themes of either movie.'], ['Mention of the movie\'s ""twisted logic.""', 'Ranking of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as the top movie in the MCU.', 'Description of the movie as ""unexpected and fun.""', 'Comparison with other MCU movies besides its ranking.']], ['', ''], [['Acceptance among specific demographics (millennials and Gen Z).', 'Industry efforts driving open banking.', 'Regulatory challenges or government policies affecting open banking.', 'Developmental phase of open banking in the U.S.'], ['Early stage of Open Banking development in the U.S. compared to the UK and Europe.', 'Existence of Open Banking in the United States.', 'Technical challenges or security concerns related to Open Banking.', 'Goals of American banks using Open Banking, including digital transformation and recalibrating customer relationships.']], ['', ''], [['Immediate comfort provided by the saddle.', 'Weight of the saddle.', 'Specific material details that make up the saddle.', 'Waterproof characteristics of the saddle.'], ['Cost of the bike seat', 'Anatomical pressure reduction and protection for sensitive areas', 'Customer reviews or satisfaction ratings', 'Installation and compatibility with different bike models']], ['', ''], [['The historical origins of empanadas and bistec a lo pobre.', 'Ingredients of the dishes (beef, olives, onions, steak, fried eggs, French fries).', 'Reference to the cultural significance of these dishes in Chile.', 'Nutritional information about the dishes.'], ['Variations or regional differences in the preparation of these dishes within Chile.', 'Cooking methods for these dishes.', 'Non-meat dish mentioned: humitas, which are primarily corn-based.', 'Nutritional information or dietary considerations related to these dishes.']], ['', ''], [['Historical timeline of interest in rocket engine reusability at NASA.', 'Specific technologies or engineering challenges involved in rocket reusability.', 'Environmental impact or considerations of reusable rockets.', 'Development efforts by the Marshall Space Flight Center.'], ['Economic implications of reusable vs. non-reusable rocket engines.', 'Specifics on the design and execution of reusable ground launch vehicles.', ""Reference to NASA's involvement in reusability projects."", 'Mention of specific dates significant to the topic.']], ['', '']]","I think B is a much better response compared to A, but A could be used in other systems.",True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,"However, A's sources do swing the pendulum back into A's quarter, and make a far more convincing argument then B does.",False,True,False,False,False,"Has more detail then B does.

It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.

Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.

Search engines and social media companies alike are discussing artificial intelligence and how they can apply it to clean up content on their sites.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.  But if you are the type of person who will turn it into an unhealthy obsession and respond poorly to seeing typical day-to-day changes in your weight, then you should probably avoid this option.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

For help with applying for engineering jobs and internships, take a look at our engineering CV and covering letter tips and our advice on filling out online applications Qualifications and training required Although a degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject may be acceptable for entry into the profession, you might find that an employer expects candidates to have studied a subject relevant to the industry in which they operate.  This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.

You'll never know unless you ask, so being proactive is always a good idea.  5.  Network, network, network!  Never underestimate the power of meeting in person—especially in the tech industry.  IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.

The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

For help with applying for engineering jobs and internships, take a look at our engineering CV and covering letter tips and our advice on filling out online applications Qualifications and training required Although a degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject may be acceptable for entry into the profession, you might find that an employer expects candidates to have studied a subject relevant to the industry in which they operate.  This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.

While qualifications are useful, you may be able to move into this career after spending time working for an employer in other areas – such as health and safety or quality control.', ""[2] Checking out local job boards and seeking out your school's career resources are good places to start.

You'll never know unless you ask, so being proactive is always a good idea.  5.  Network, network, network!  Never underestimate the power of meeting in person—especially in the tech industry.  IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.

The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of

By contrast, a pyramid scheme involves participants recruiting further investors beneath them, with returns primarily derived from new recruitments rather than legitimate business activities; these schemes also collapse when no new recruits can be found. Both schemes rely on continual recruitment of new members to sustain payouts but differ in the structure and the source of the purported returns.', 'Both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes recruit investors, but Ponzi schemes operate without a hierarchical system, unlike pyramid schemes which are structured hierarchically.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.  But if you are the type of person who will turn it into an unhealthy obsession and respond poorly to seeing typical day-to-day changes in your weight, then you should probably avoid this option.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.

While qualifications are useful, you may be able to move into this career after spending time working for an employer in other areas – such as health and safety or quality control.', ""[2] Checking out local job boards and seeking out your school's career resources are good places to start.

IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.

The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of

Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.  The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""[2] Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

In some instances, the coral enlarged by up to 340 percent of its normal size.  For the scientists who have devoted their lives to studying these living structures, observing the bleached reefs can be an emotionally fraught experience.  In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.  They kept the coral exposed to that heat for more than a week.  Heat is one of several triggers that stresses coral — and when stressed, the animals evict the smaller organisms living inside them.""]], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] Pension cold-calling banned Nuisance calls about pensions are now illegal.

However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.

You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People.

The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""[2] Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

In some instances, the coral enlarged by up to 340 percent of its normal size.  For the scientists who have devoted their lives to studying these living structures, observing the bleached reefs can be an emotionally fraught experience.  In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.  They kept the coral exposed to that heat for more than a week.  Heat is one of several triggers that stresses coral — and when stressed, the animals evict the smaller organisms living inside them.""]], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] Pension cold-calling banned Nuisance calls about pensions are now illegal.

After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.

The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.

After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.

The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.

MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.

The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.

The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.

After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'  So, which heroes with Latino heritage could make the leap from comics to the cinema?"", ""[2] Could Marvel bring Blade into the MCU and the vampires that come with him? Could the magical and mystical elements of Doctor Strange be used as the groundwork for introducing Moon Knight?  Or will Marvel opt for someone else entirely ?  Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit. Coates brought in fresh air to the medium for a few reasons: he has a more political background in writing, and he's a black man writing about a black character.  Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, both women of the muslim faith as well, created the character in 2013 and haven't looked back since.  The series has been on the New York Times Bestseller list, a true indication that this is high quality material.  In an interview with Makers, Amanat starts off by noting 'authentic storytelling is powerful.'

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.  Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch."", ""[2] By 1961, with the encouragement of the Democratic Party campaign for the presidency, Americans had begun agonizing over the 'missile gap.' After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The

It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.

Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms. It's all on YouTube.  I've made these videos to make it as easy as possible to get to know this topic.  Since there are only 7 videos in this series, you'll need more material to learn more advanced topics.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.  After practicing on your own for a few weeks, you should start doing mock interviews.  How to do mock interviews Basically, pair up with your friends, and give each other problems from the resources I mentioned above."", ""[3] Interview tips for success Now that you are comfortable with how to handle the post-interview follow up, here are some interview tips that could help you in your next interview: Research the company first Before your interview, research the company to better understand what they do, what their hiring needs might be and basic information you might be expected to know to get your foot in the door. Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

It may also inspire you to begin making your own beauty products at home.  Why should I spend the time making beauty products at home?  1.  Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Step 5: Prepare for coding interviews Coding interviews at companies like Google and Microsoft are hard, but it is somewhat straight-forward to prepare for them.  Once you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, I'd recommend these three resources for practice: Leetcode — an interactive platform for practicing coding interview problems.  Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

How to do mock interviews Basically, pair up with your friends, and give each other problems from the resources I mentioned above."", ""[3] Interview tips for success Now that you are comfortable with how to handle the post-interview follow up, here are some interview tips that could help you in your next interview: Research the company first Before your interview, research the company to better understand what they do, what their hiring needs might be and basic information you might be expected to know to get your foot in the door. Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.  'When we start getting into more complicated concepts around identity, around knowledge, this is where search engines start to fail us.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that the public really relies upon search engines to give them what they think will be the truth, or something vetted, or something that's credible' Noble said.  Search engines and social media companies alike are discussing artificial intelligence and how they can apply it to clean up content on their sites.  Unfortunately, if the AI used to sort and filter content is based on existing information and algorithms, the existing biases will be reinforced, not fixed.

In it, Noble is greatly concerned with looking at the ways the Black community is commercialized in powerful technological companies.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.  'When we start getting into more complicated concepts around identity, around knowledge, this is where search engines start to fail us.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that the public really relies upon search engines to give them what they think will be the truth, or something vetted, or something that's credible' Noble said.  Search engines and social media companies alike are discussing artificial intelligence and how they can apply it to clean up content on their sites.  Unfortunately, if the AI used to sort and filter content is based on existing information and algorithms, the existing biases will be reinforced, not fixed.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.

Every fraction of additional warming above 1.5°C will bring worsening impacts, threatening lives, food sources, livelihoods and economies worldwide.  Countries are not on track to fulfill the promises they have made.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.  'When we start getting into more complicated concepts around identity, around knowledge, this is where search engines start to fail us.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that the public really relies upon search engines to give them what they think will be the truth, or something vetted, or something that's credible' Noble said.  Search engines and social media companies alike are discussing artificial intelligence and how they can apply it to clean up content on their sites.  Unfortunately, if the AI used to sort and filter content is based on existing information and algorithms, the existing biases will be reinforced, not fixed.

One counterargument though, is that the search engines themselves aren't the problem.  If the information they are crawling is biased, that same bias will be introduced into their search results.  'When we start getting into more complicated concepts around identity, around knowledge, this is where search engines start to fail us.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that the public really relies upon search engines to give them what they think will be the truth, or something vetted, or something that's credible' Noble said.  Search engines and social media companies alike are discussing artificial intelligence and how they can apply it to clean up content on their sites.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.  But if you are the type of person who will turn it into an unhealthy obsession and respond poorly to seeing typical day-to-day changes in your weight, then you should probably avoid this option.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs. Some larger employers operate graduate training schemes in quality assurance; early applications for these are advisable.  For help with applying for engineering jobs and internships, take a look at our engineering CV and covering letter tips and our advice on filling out online applications Qualifications and training required Although a degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject may be acceptable for entry into the profession, you might find that an employer expects candidates to have studied a subject relevant to the industry in which they operate.  This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.  You can read our article on engineering postgraduate study to explore your options.  While qualifications are useful, you may be able to move into this career after spending time working for an employer in other areas – such as health and safety or quality control.', ""[2] Checking out local job boards and seeking out your school's career resources are good places to start. But don't be afraid to reach out to local companies without visible internship job postings.  Sometimes a company could benefit from an intern but hasn't yet considered the need for one.  You'll never know unless you ask, so being proactive is always a good idea.  5.  Network, network, network!  Never underestimate the power of meeting in person—especially in the tech industry.  IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.  Consider asking to shadow them if they're open to it.

You'll be able to list programming experience on your resume.  3: Be willing to take a pay cut It's no secret that the economy is a wreck right now.  The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of positions on a development team that are not hands-on development jobs, but will help get you closer to your goal.""]], ['', ''], ['', '']]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents.""], ['', ''], ['The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.', 'The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: Keyword: Oguta Lake Holiday Complex'], ['', ''], [""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources."", ''], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents."", ''], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: break-in and cover-up', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.']]","[[['Presence of numerous significant cultural centers.', 'Comparison of Buenos Aires’ cultural scene with other South American cities outside the context of theater.', 'Status as the birthplace of the Tango.', 'Modern cultural trends or contemporary art scenes.'], ['Governmental policies supporting the cultural sector in Buenos Aires.', 'Presence of internationally-known opera houses, museums, bookstores, and cultural associations.', 'Analysis of audience demographics or cultural participation rates.', ""Comparison of Buenos Aires' cultural scene with cities outside of South America.""]], ['', ''], [['It notes the lack of specifics on the frequency of running needed for weight loss.', 'The impact of running speed and duration on weight loss effectiveness.', 'Mental health benefits of running.', 'Alternative exercises or methods for weight loss aside from running.'], ['Recommended running distance per week for effective weight loss.', 'Advice on gradually increasing running activity to prevent burnout and injury.', 'Psychological benefits of running besides weight loss.', 'Suggested running duration and frequency for more significant weight loss results.']], ['', ''], [['The economic impact of tourism in Enugu and Minna.', 'Recommended tourist destinations in Nigeria, including Enugu and Minna.', 'Enugu\'s nickname as the ""Coal City.""', 'Detailed descriptions of the Nike Holiday Resort, Iva Valley, or the Nmanwu Cultural Festival.'], ['Accessible and constant electricity due to proximity to Kainji Dam.', 'Transportation options within the city.', 'Information about local cuisine or food specialties.', 'Highlighted tourist sites like Nike Holiday Resort.']], ['', ''], [['Legal consequences for participating in or running these schemes.', 'Mechanism of failure for both schemes.', 'Impact on victims who lose their investments in these schemes.', 'Description of Ponzi schemes.'], ['Impact of these schemes on individual investors and the broader economy.', 'Measures to identify and protect against such schemes.', 'Difference in structure between Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes.', 'Legal implications and consequences for those involved in Ponzi and pyramid schemes.']], ['', ''], [['The impact of social media on professional networking.', 'Challenges or barriers to effective networking.', 'Online networking tools and platforms specific to the tech industry.', 'Importance of networking in entering the tech industry.'], ['Networking with industry professionals.', 'The importance of continuous learning and skill development.', 'Utilizing online platforms for networking and job searching.', 'Accepting a lower salary as an entry strategy.']], ['', ''], [[""President Richard Nixon’s attempt to cover up the administration's involvement."", 'The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters as the basis of the Watergate scandal.', 'The location of the break-in, the Watergate office complex.', 'The impact of the scandal on American public opinion and politics thereafter.'], ['Subsequent political reforms and changes in government transparency regulations', 'The role of the media in uncovering the scandal', 'Involvement of President Nixon', 'Legal proceedings and outcomes (e.g., trials, convictions)']], ['', '']]","Response A highlights concrete cultural markers (theaters, tango origins, architecture), and it cites references in the second version.

Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'

'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs. Some larger employers operate graduate training schemes in quality assurance; early applications for these are advisable.  For help with applying for engineering jobs and internships, take a look at our engineering CV and covering letter tips and our advice on filling out online applications Qualifications and training required Although a degree or higher national diploma (HND) in any subject may be acceptable for entry into the profession, you might find that an employer expects candidates to have studied a subject relevant to the industry in which they operate.  This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.  You can read our article on engineering postgraduate study to explore your options.  While qualifications are useful, you may be able to move into this career after spending time working for an employer in other areas – such as health and safety or quality control.', ""[2] Checking out local job boards and seeking out your school's career resources are good places to start. But don't be afraid to reach out to local companies without visible internship job postings.  Sometimes a company could benefit from an intern but hasn't yet considered the need for one.  You'll never know unless you ask, so being proactive is always a good idea.  5.  Network, network, network!  Never underestimate the power of meeting in person—especially in the tech industry.  IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.  Consider asking to shadow them if they're open to it.

You'll be able to list programming experience on your resume.  3: Be willing to take a pay cut It's no secret that the economy is a wreck right now.  The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of positions on a development team that are not hands-on development jobs, but will help get you closer to your goal.""]], ['', ''], ['', '']]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents.""], ['', ''], ['The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.', 'The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: Keyword: Oguta Lake Holiday Complex'], ['', ''], [""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources."", ''], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents."", ''], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: break-in and cover-up', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.']]","[[['Presence of numerous significant cultural centers.', 'Comparison of Buenos Aires’ cultural scene with other South American cities outside the context of theater.', 'Status as the birthplace of the Tango.', 'Modern cultural trends or contemporary art scenes.'], ['Governmental policies supporting the cultural sector in Buenos Aires.', 'Presence of internationally-known opera houses, museums, bookstores, and cultural associations.', 'Analysis of audience demographics or cultural participation rates.', ""Comparison of Buenos Aires' cultural scene with cities outside of South America.""]], ['', ''], [['It notes the lack of specifics on the frequency of running needed for weight loss.', 'The impact of running speed and duration on weight loss effectiveness.', 'Mental health benefits of running.', 'Alternative exercises or methods for weight loss aside from running.'], ['Recommended running distance per week for effective weight loss.', 'Advice on gradually increasing running activity to prevent burnout and injury.', 'Psychological benefits of running besides weight loss.', 'Suggested running duration and frequency for more significant weight loss results.']], ['', ''], [['The economic impact of tourism in Enugu and Minna.', 'Recommended tourist destinations in Nigeria, including Enugu and Minna.', 'Enugu\'s nickname as the ""Coal City.""', 'Detailed descriptions of the Nike Holiday Resort, Iva Valley, or the Nmanwu Cultural Festival.'], ['Accessible and constant electricity due to proximity to Kainji Dam.', 'Transportation options within the city.', 'Information about local cuisine or food specialties.', 'Highlighted tourist sites like Nike Holiday Resort.']], ['', ''], [['Legal consequences for participating in or running these schemes.', 'Mechanism of failure for both schemes.', 'Impact on victims who lose their investments in these schemes.', 'Description of Ponzi schemes.'], ['Impact of these schemes on individual investors and the broader economy.', 'Measures to identify and protect against such schemes.', 'Difference in structure between Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes.', 'Legal implications and consequences for those involved in Ponzi and pyramid schemes.']], ['', ''], [['The impact of social media on professional networking.', 'Challenges or barriers to effective networking.', 'Online networking tools and platforms specific to the tech industry.', 'Importance of networking in entering the tech industry.'], ['Networking with industry professionals.', 'The importance of continuous learning and skill development.', 'Utilizing online platforms for networking and job searching.', 'Accepting a lower salary as an entry strategy.']], ['', ''], [[""President Richard Nixon’s attempt to cover up the administration's involvement."", 'The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters as the basis of the Watergate scandal.', 'The location of the break-in, the Watergate office complex.', 'The impact of the scandal on American public opinion and politics thereafter.'], ['Subsequent political reforms and changes in government transparency regulations', 'The role of the media in uncovering the scandal', 'Involvement of President Nixon', 'Legal proceedings and outcomes (e.g., trials, convictions)']], ['', '']]","Response A provides more culturally specific and historically grounded details (like tango and European influences), supported by references.

However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.

IT is a surprisingly collaborative field, so candidates who can represent their ability to connect with other professionals (e.g., dropping a comment like 'my mentor suggested…' in a job interview) will stand out from candidates who go it alone.  'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.

You'll be able to list programming experience on your resume.  3: Be willing to take a pay cut It's no secret that the economy is a wreck right now.  The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.  Unfortunately, the overall trend in development is that the first five years or so of a career are getting increasingly difficult.  4: Look at non-programming development jobs There are plenty of

Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.  But if you are the type of person who will turn it into an unhealthy obsession and respond poorly to seeing typical day-to-day changes in your weight, then you should probably avoid this option.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', ''], ['', [""[1] External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'  No wonder why many runners find it difficult to lose weight."", ""[3] Weighing Yourself Once A Month Let's be honest here… in terms of monitoring progress, weighing yourself just once per month is pretty terrible and not recommended at all from an accuracy or tracking standpoint for obvious reasons. But on the other hand, if you're someone who will be driven to an eating disorder (or are recovering from one) or will just generally go nuts as a result of weighing yourself too frequently, then once per month may be just right for you.  And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

This might include materials science/technology, food science/technology, textile technology, polymer science/technology, process engineering, production engineering, physics or mathematics.  Some employers will look favourably on business studies/management qualifications, too.  For some positions, a postgraduate qualification or a technical degree background is necessary.

'Go to professional networking events for the areas you want to get into,' Buickians advises.  Whether for BSA, project management, software engineering, QA or another niche, it's helpful to learn about the projects these professionals are working on and think about ways you may be able to help them.

The common theme I keep hearing is that while there are some jobs out there, the pay packages are really tight.  Many employers are locking people into lower salaries and 'resetting' the pay levels.  Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.  Entry-level positions are also the ones most vulnerable to offshoring.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""[2] Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.  The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""[2] Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

For the scientists who have devoted their lives to studying these living structures, observing the bleached reefs can be an emotionally fraught experience.  In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.  They kept the coral exposed to that heat for more than a week.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.

Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""[2] Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""[2] Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.  The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""[2] Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""[2] Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.  The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.', ""[2] Loss   of   Biodiversity      Coral   reefs   (both   tropical   and   cold   water)   are   very   sensitive   to   ocean   acidification,   with   60   per   cent   of   reefs   currently   threatened   by   a   combination   of   ocean   warming,   acidification   and   other   anthropogenic   impacts,   a   number   that   will   rise   to   90   per   cent   by   2030   and   about   100   per   cent   by   2050.

For the scientists who have devoted their lives to studying these living structures, observing the bleached reefs can be an emotionally fraught experience.  In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.  They kept the coral exposed to that heat for more than a week.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.

Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.

In 2018, we watched 'Black Panther,' the first film about an African-American superhero that became a worldwide blockbuster, breaking several historical records.  And this year, on March 8th, the story of 'Captain Marvel' finally became a movie, the first from the MCU with a solo female superhero.  After seeing this vital approach to diversity and inclusion, it's logical to wonder if we will soon see a movie with a Latino superhero from Marvel.  The answer is yes.  At least that is what Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, said in an interview with EFE.  'Our audience is global, and we want people to identify with our stories, which is the core of our plans for the future,' he said.  And although he did not give many details, the executive did say this possible film could be included in Phase Four of the MCU, which will begin in 2020 and will include the first story of an Asian superhero, Shang-Chi, the 'Master of Kung Fu.'

Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said 'I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.'"", ""[3] Journalist Ta-nehisi Coates even took over Black Panther after Secret Wars ended, the Marvel event that shook up the entire universe and changed the status quo a bit.

Black Panther played such a pivotal role in Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and Secret Wars that fans were going to flock to the book no matter who was writing it.  It was an excellent move by Marvel to have a person of color writing such a book.  Marvel's determination to hire other non-white male writers continued with the creation of Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.  Kamala, a teenage muslim girl living in Jersey City, has been called by some the new Peter Parker.  She's awkward and nerdy yet strong and loving.  Writer G.

Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs.  They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach.  US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States.  More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards.  While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set.  In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters.  Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.', ""[2] US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services. Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers' financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements.  How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well.  By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength.  However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States.  Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice?  Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8).  Going 'all-in' may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks."", ""[3] Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks' digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, 'Who owns my data?' is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Even though this saddle is a little chunky compared to their counterpart, but still this saddle is lighter with the weight of 360 grams only.

The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines.  MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET.  MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on some flights.   The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975.  Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC.  The first 'Enterprise' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October.  In March 1978, the 'Enterprise' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC.

After the elections and the inauguration, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and Congress set a new course for NASA, preempting existing developmental programs and schedules.  The United States, before the decade is out, should land 'a man on the Moon' and return him safely to Earth. 11 The Apollo program became the leading effort.  An orbital Space Station and Earth-to-orbit spacecraft, while they might contribute to a continuing presence in space and provide a platform for further lunar or planetary exploration, did not contribute to the short term goal of an American lunar landing within the decade.  NASA readjusted its schedules and priorities to accommodate Apollo.  The Space Station and the reusable aerospace craft remained viable, but future, options.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), in particular, continued to study the reusable vehicle concept and as early as January 1963, developed a statement of work for a fully reusable rocket-powered vehicle that could carry civilian passengers, and a sizable payload.  Marshall awarded independent contracts to Lockheed Aircraft and North American Aviation for design and development studies."", '[3] FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 281 Thus, in March 1966, a special NASA planning team developed a statement of work for a reusable ground launch vehicle, and in October Marshall Space Flight Center and the Manned Spacecraft Center agreed to pursue independent study and research on such a spacecraft. NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.  R&D costs for new logistics systems are in competition with dollars to develop payloads and markets (dollars are scarce).  14 Nevertheless, NASA put a decision for the development of a reusable vehicle on hold.']]]","[['', ''], ['', ""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources.""], ['', ''], ['The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: Black Panther', 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], ['', ""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents.""], ['', ''], [""The response is not supported by verifiable references, and the individual claims cannot be reliably cross-checked against sources."", ''], ['', ''], [""The response focuses on just one aspect and may miss important points related to: bistec a lo pobre (poor man's steak)"", 'The response covers multiple aspects of the topic, providing a broad view.'], ['', ''], [""The response has no traceable origin and it cannot be attributed to specific source documents."", '']]","[[['Representation of different ethnic groups and genders in superhero roles.', 'Specific challenges faced while implementing these diversity initiatives.', 'Inclusion of diverse writers in the creation of characters and stories.', ""Financial impact of diverse casting on Marvel Studios' earnings.""], ['Introduction of ""Black Panther"" as a major film focusing on an African-American superhero.', ""Plans for introducing a Latino superhero in MCU's Phase Four."", 'Audience reception to the introduction of diverse characters in Marvel films.', ""Marvel Studios' commitment to diversity in casting and character representation.""]], ['', ''], [[""Evaluation of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' on its consistent excellence."", ""Box office performance of 'Black Panther' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'"", 'Recognition of both movies as among the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).', 'Specific plot details or themes of either movie.'], ['Mention of the movie\'s ""twisted logic.""', 'Ranking of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as the top movie in the MCU.', 'Description of the movie as ""unexpected and fun.""', 'Comparison with other MCU movies besides its ranking.']], ['', ''], [['Acceptance among specific demographics (millennials and Gen Z).', 'Industry efforts driving open banking.', 'Regulatory challenges or government policies affecting open banking.', 'Developmental phase of open banking in the U.S.'], ['Early stage of Open Banking development in the U.S. compared to the UK and Europe.', 'Existence of Open Banking in the United States.', 'Technical challenges or security concerns related to Open Banking.', 'Goals of American banks using Open Banking, including digital transformation and recalibrating customer relationships.']], ['', ''], [['Immediate comfort provided by the saddle.', 'Weight of the saddle.', 'Specific material details that make up the saddle.', 'Waterproof characteristics of the saddle.'], ['Cost of the bike seat', 'Anatomical pressure reduction and protection for sensitive areas', 'Customer reviews or satisfaction ratings', 'Installation and compatibility with different bike models']], ['', ''], [['The historical origins of empanadas and bistec a lo pobre.', 'Ingredients of the dishes (beef, olives, onions, steak, fried eggs, French fries).', 'Reference to the cultural significance of these dishes in Chile.', 'Nutritional information about the dishes.'], ['Variations or regional differences in the preparation of these dishes within Chile.', 'Cooking methods for these dishes.', 'Non-meat dish mentioned: humitas, which are primarily corn-based.', 'Nutritional information or dietary considerations related to these dishes.']], ['', ''], [['Historical timeline of interest in rocket engine reusability at NASA.', 'Specific technologies or engineering challenges involved in rocket reusability.', 'Environmental impact or considerations of reusable rockets.', 'Development efforts by the Marshall Space Flight Center.'], ['Economic implications of reusable vs. non-reusable rocket engines.', 'Specifics on the design and execution of reusable ground launch vehicles.', ""Reference to NASA's involvement in reusability projects."", 'Mention of specific dates significant to the topic.']], ['', '']]","Response A provides concrete examples of diversity efforts, including diverse casting and writers involved in character creation (e.g., Kamala Khan’s Muslim women creators).

Making beauty products at home will provide you with the safest and most personalized products possible.  Only you know exactly what your skin issues are.  Maybe you are dealing with early signs of aging, have dry or sensitive skin.  Natural ingredients are always the better alternative to chemicals.  Making your own beauty products means customized products that meet your personal needs.  2  .  Making beauty products at home is very frugal.  It is estimated that the average American family spends $2,000 annually on hygiene items.  Homemade beauty products require fewer ingredients and tend to last longer than store bought.  3.  Homemade beauty products make great gifts.  Homemade gifts are always more personal and a practical way to live a more sustainable lifestyle!  4.  Homemade beauty products are free of toxins and harmful substances.  According to the EWG, only 11 percent of cosmetic ingredients have been tested for safety by the cosmetic industry.

The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.  The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.  In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.  According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.  A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.  An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position.', ""[2] It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.  The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $ 956 million).  The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri .  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage'.  It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."", '[3] Taj Mahal History The Taj Mahal was built by one of the Mughal Emperors, Shah Jahan. Mughal dynasty had ruled much of the northern India from 16 th to 18 th century.  Shah Jahan had become the emperor of Agra in 1628.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal for his most favorite wife, Mumtaz Begum.  The ream name of Mumtaz Begum was Arjumand Banu Begum.  Shah Jahan cut off the hands of Taj Mahal workers so that they may not build one of its kinds.  Mumtaz begum died in 1631 after giving birth to the 14 th child.  The construction of Taj Mahal began the very next year in 1632.  Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal in the memory of Mumtaz Begum.  More than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants participated in the construction of Taj Mahal.  It took 21 years to complete the Taj Mahal.  Shah Jahan.  Taj Mahal facts for kids.

They may not be the funnest thing in the world, but the more experience you have working on these types of problems the more confidence you'll have when presented with a new one.  In the same regard, you should not turn down any invitations to interview—even if you don't think that you'll take the job.  The reason for this is that you'll become more experienced with the process of taking interviews and feel more comfortable with each one you take.  That way, your confidence will show up when it really matters.  Another good tip is to practice coding in a plain text editor or with pen on paper.  If you've been programming for many years you may not realize how much you've come to rely on the IDE to autocomplete your syntax and point out errors immediately.  You likely won't have this available to you in the interview, especially if you're asked to code on a whiteboard during an on-site interview.  So get some practice coding your favorite language unassisted by the computer to become better at remembering proper syntax."", ""[2] To learn the basics, I'd recommend my video series on data structures and algorithms.

Cracking the Coding Interview — a popular book on coding interviews.  Daily Coding Problem — a mailing list that gives you one problem a day.

Sometimes interviewers open an interview with something like, 'Tell us what you know about us.'  You'll be better prepared to address the interviewer if you are prepared with some foundational information.  Practice answers to common interview questions Before you go into an interview, it's recommended you practice answers to common questions.  Questions like, 'Tell me about yourself,' or 'Why do you think you are a good fit for the position,' are likely to come up, so be prepared to answer them by practicing your answers.  Get familiar with the job description The job description offers insight as to what the company's needs are and what skills they are seeking in an employee.

Your ability to tolerate high training levels will be dramatically reduced.  So you can't 'diet' by cutting calories if you're training because you'll run poorly.  And to lose weight (and keep it off), you have to run smart.  Train Smart to Lose More Weight There's comforting news for competitive runners: smart training can help you lose more weight than 'just' running.  When your training is designed properly with a time goal in mind, you'll shed pounds faster than if you were just running for fun.  I've asked a lot of runners 'what fast workouts have you done recently?'  And the responses are often a variation of the same answer: '45 minute – 1hr runs at the same pace a few times per week' 'None…' 'Once a week I finish a run a little faster than usual and try to get a negative split.'  'Random intervals when I remember… about once per month.'

And The Winner Is…  So how often should you weigh yourself?  As usual, the true best answer is that it depends on you and the type of person you are.  Every Day  In terms of the most accurate way to do it, weighing yourself every day is the best option.  It's how I do it, and as long as you do it correctly (take the weekly average) and don't let the daily fluctuations negatively affect you, then it's how I'd recommend it be done.  That's why it's the tracking approach I use in my Superior Fat Loss program.

Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.  On the other hand, they could have invested differently without being scammed.  The wide gap between 'money in' and 'fictitious gains' make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme.   Section::::Similar schemes.   A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return.  However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:  BULLET::::- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a 'hub' for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  (In fact, failure to recruit typically means 'no' investment return.)"", ""[2] Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes A Ponzi scheme (named after 1920's swindler Charles Ponzi) is a ploy wherein earlier investors are repaid through the funds deposited by subsequent investors. Charles Ponzi took investors for $10 million by promising 40 percent returns from arbitrage profits on International Postal Reply Coupons.  In a Ponzi scheme, the underlying investment claims are usually entirely fictional; very few, if any, actual physical assets or investments generally exist.  As the number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out.  A Ponzi bubble will burst when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the payments investors are expecting to receive.  When the scheme collapses (as it always does), investors may lose their entire investment in the fraud.  In many cases, the perpetrator will have spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the bursting of the bubble.  Similarly, a pyramid scheme is a fraudulent multi-level marketing strategy whereby investors earn potential returns by recruiting more and more other investors.  Multi-level marketing strategies are not intrinsically fraudulent, and there are many legitimate multi-level marketing companies offering various consumer products and services."", ""[3] Each recruit is required to pay an 'investment' to the recruiter above him and to recruit more investors. If any recruit can get just ten recruitments under him, he or she will make back his initial investment plus a small profit.  This process continues until there are no longer any recruits to be found and the lower level can no longer support the upper levels.  There are some variations on this basic model.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Ponzi Schemes?  Experts disagree as to whether Ponzi schemes are pyramid schemes.  Certainly, there are similarities between the two.  While Ponzi schemes are certainly fraudulent, they are not necessarily hierarchical in nature, which is one of the defining characteristics of the pyramid scheme.  Additionally, in a Ponzi scheme, 'investors' are not asked to recruit others, nor are they told where their payoff would come from.  In this sense, Ponzi schemes operate at a level that is vaguer than the traditional pyramid scheme.  How Do Pyramid Schemes Differ from Multi-Level Marketing?  Although multi-level marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme in that sellers are encouraged to bring in others who work under them, the key difference is that MLM companies offer a concrete product that is sold to consumers.""]], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] Opportunities are advertised online, by careers services and on websites such as Quality Jobs (the jobs website of the Chartered Quality Institute) and New Scientist Jobs.

Recent college graduates (many of whom are finding themselves unemployed for months after graduation) are the competition at entry level.  In addition, most recent graduates do not have the financial obligations that experienced workers do and are willing and able to work for less money than someone who has been out of school long enough to have a mortgage, a family, and a car payment.

It is important to feel comfortable so make sure you have your bike dialed in before you get into a habit of riding it with the wrong saddle height, handlebar reach, or cleat placement.  Your body adjusts and even the wrong fit bikes can feel comfortable for some time, but beneath the surface it is doing more damage to your muscles, bones, and soft tissues.  A quick story to illustrate my point; my friend got a professional bike fitting for his first major road bike purchase.  I'm talking laser levels, ergonomic stationary bikes, video cameras, $800; the whole shebang.  Fast forward about 3 years and 1000's of miles on this bike, he takes it in for a routine seasonal maintenance.  After 2-3 short rides, he starts getting major pain in his knee.  Sensing something was up, he takes it back into the shop and finds that one of his pedal clip spacers to raise the height of his clip for his shoes was left off when he picked the bike up."", ""[2] Carry on reading to find some essential tips on making your bike seat more comfortable. Choose the right saddle for your bike The first thing up in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is choosing the right saddle.  You must go for a seat that is made to meet your biking needs.  You can either choose a road bike saddle, a saddle for an MTB, or a leisure bike.  But choose a saddle that is best suited for your cycling requirements.  If you choose a saddle that meets your cycling demands, it will allow you to find the correct option that will go well with your different riding positions.  You'll be in a more comfortable position and will be in better control of your ride.  Adjusting the saddle The second most important thing in how to make a bike seat more comfortable is adjusting it correctly.  The primary elements here are the height of the seat, its tilt, and its aft/fore position.  A seat that is too high/low will make your hips tilt when you are pedaling.  And as the motion increases, the potential of chafing and rubbing increases as well.  Hence, you need to choose the correct seat position by standing right next to it.  Place your hands on your hip bones and make the adjustments according to that height."", ""[3] Here Is Why You Should Choose The Best Bike For Tall People. Comfort and Convenience Isn't true that you would like to be comfortable all the way on your bike?  Comfort is determined by the size, style and quality of the bicycle.  The right size and style will ensure that the bike is well-fitting for you.  So, there's not the inconvenience of either poor saddle height, narrow handlebars or short stem length that normally result in poor positioning or posture on the bike.  When all these are right, you're always going to be comfortable and confident.  Better Performance and Efficiency Whatever purpose you are buying the bicycle for, you want the most efficient model which exhibits high levels of performance.  And, this is always the mark of the best bikes for tall guys For example, if it is a mountain bike, you need a bike that would easily climb difficult trails.  So it has that climbing power.  You also want to move fast, and the bike has that power to accelerate.  The right bike would mean that chances of falling or crashing are limited because they possess high rolling resistance against coasting aspects.  This enhances the personal safety of the rider, which is our next point.  Improve Personal Safety For routine riders, you probably know much better about safety and cycling.""], ''], ['', ''], ['', ['[1] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.  An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.  A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans.  These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.  The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas.  In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral.

In the Guam coral reef, some 85 percent of the coral has bleached.  Seeing the damage this year was particularly tough for University of Guam coral ecologist Laurie Raymundo.  'I cried for an hour, right into my mask, as I witnessed the extent to which our lovely Tumon Bay corals were bleaching and dying,' she wrote on Facebook, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month.  The Great Barrier Reef has also taken a turn for the worse.  Surveys of nearly 1,000 reefs that make up the barrier spotted bleaching 93 percent of the time.  In the Queensland study, the researchers raised the temperature of the ambient water from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 90 degrees over the course of 12 hours.
